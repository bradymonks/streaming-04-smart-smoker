# BBQproducer.py Script

I used my bonus project from Module 4 as a basis for the Smoker Producer script.

I already had multiple queues set up in that script, so it was simple enough to change the name of the .csv file and add one more queue. From there all I had to do was change which columns I was reading (1 and 2 to 2, 3, and 4). 

# Consumer Scripts

I wanted to put together some consumer scripts right now just to make sure the messages were being sent successfully but haven't configure them for Module 6's assignment yet. Once again I used my bonus consumers from Module 4 as basis for these. I just had to remove the code regarding writing the messages to a new .csv file and rename the queues to match up with the producer script.
